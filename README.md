What does the extension do?

Displays the last Okcash rate/price at the following exchanges:

* [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/)
* [Bleutrade](https://bleutrade.com/)
* [Cryptopia](https://cryptopia.co.nz/)
* [YoBit](https://yobit.net/)

The price it's updated every 60 seconds or when you clicks on the icon.

You have possibility to configure notifications so user gets notified when the rate/price rises over or falls below configured threshold. Once the limit is met, user is notified and the limit is set to that value, this is repeated every time new limit is crossed. To disable the notifications or set a new limit go to options panel if you get annoyed. xD

The colours badge change when the rate/price up and down.

* Black: Rate/price did not change from last fetch.
* Green: Rate/price went up.
* Red: Rate/price went down.

Depending on the rate/price it might not fit very well. Just hover on the icon badge and the full rate/price it's displaying.
